The framework used for this project is [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is an open-source mobile application development framework developed by Google. Flutter uses the [Dart](https://dart.dev/) programming language and provides developers with the ability to develop fast, modern, and performant mobile applications.

This application is designed for Flutter [SDK version](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/sdk/releases) 2.18.5 and above, and uses packages such as [provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) for state management. Additionally, [flavor](https://pub.dev/packages/flavor) and [flutter_dotenv](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_dotenv) packages are used to simplify configuration processes.

The [intl](https://pub.dev/packages/intl) package is used for localization purposes, while the [cupertino_icons](https://pub.dev/packages/cupertino_icons) package is used to create visual elements in the application.

For data storage, the application uses [shared_preferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences) package, and tools such as [flutter_gen_runner](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_gen_runner) and is used to facilitate data management. The [flutter_lints](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_lints) package can also be used for different purposes during the application development process.

```

This package is divided into various sub-packages, including data modeling, database operations, and other helper functions. The file structure includes:

"base: The part where the basis of the application is determined. The files "base_view", "navigation", "view_model".

"extensions: File created to call the most used features of the application by collecting them in one place. The files "common_extension.dart".

"model: This folder includes the classes used for data modeling in the application. The files "booking_model.dart". The ".g.dart" files are necessary for these classes to be automatically serialized using the "json_serializable" library.

utils: This folder contains various helper functions used throughout the application. The "constants" folder includes constants such as colors, sizes, and icons used in the application. 

This file structure can be used to organize the essential components of the application and provides data models and helper functions used throughout the project.

```bash
ðŸ“¦flavors  
 â”£ ðŸ“œmain_dev.dart  
 â”— ðŸ“œmain_prod.dart
 â”— ðŸ“œmain_test.dart

```

The "flavors" folder provides the configurations and settings necessary for running the application in different environments.

The "main_dev.dart" and "main_prod.dart" files contain the main files of the application for development and QA (quality assurance) environments, respectively. These files include different configurations that allow the application to behave differently in different environments. These configurations may include environment-specific features such as server connections, logging levels, or test data.

```bash
ðŸ“¦gen  
 â”— ðŸ“œassets.gen.dart
 
```

The "gen" folder contains various code generation tools for the project. The "assets.gen.dart" file provides constants for accessing files in the application's assets folder. These constants can be used anywhere in the application and can be made compatible with other libraries used to manage the application's assets.
